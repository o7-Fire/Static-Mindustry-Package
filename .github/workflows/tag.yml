# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  schedule:
   - cron:  '0 10 * * *'
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
